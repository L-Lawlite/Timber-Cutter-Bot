 Parent file for models
 ```json
 {
 "parent": "item/handheld",
 "textures": {
 "layer0": "item/<base item"
 },
 
 "overrides": [
 { "predicate": {"custom_model_data": <number}, "model": "item/<model's json file"}
 
 ]
 
 
 }```
 
 
 Item model json file first part
 
 ```json
 {
 "parent": "item/handheld_rod",
 "textures": {
 "layer0": "item/<item texture"
 }
 }```
 

 this is the parent model list:
 ```handheld_rod - carrot on a stick or warped fungus on a stick
 handheld - tools and weapons such as swords and hoes
 generated - everything else```
 

 texture (png files) goes into
 ```resourcepacks\<namespace\assets\minecraft\textures\item```
 
 and the 2 json go in 
 ```resourcepacks\<namespace\assets\minecraft\models\item```
 
 
 if you are still struggling to get a working custom model data json file go to (https://gravitowl.github.io/modeldata.html) and generate it by your own! (credit to gravitowl)
